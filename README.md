# play-scala-reactivemongo-guice
This is a sample project using Play Framework(2.3.8), Scala(2.11.5), ReactiveMongo plugin(0.10.5.0.akka23), and Guice(3.0). Also including the initialization of CSRF filter and simple custom wrapped authentication request.

My purpose is to help others who wants to start developing a web application and use this template as a bootstrap. The project setup is pretty straightforward and so is the code as it is intended to be a working example only.

More description will be added later. This is my first repository in GitHub so I am trying to put as much details as possible and hope it can help.
